Description

Program can be used to generate bitmap fonts. With it, you can:
   (in [] is associated tab (middle) or list tab (right))

1. Choose font from existing system TrueType fonts [Fonts].
2. Use character range and change font's properties [Font]
   or enter custom text [edit].
3. Adjust every char properties [Chars] and
   create fixed width groups (eg. for digits).
   Making whole font fixed/variable width
   can be changed in [Font]: fix/var.
4. Add glow effect to chars (distance or additive type) [Glow].
   Chars need extra space for glow to fit (and not to be truncated)
   params ax,ay,bx,by adjust that [Font].
5. Adjust generation of alpha channel [Alpha].
6. Save texture (image) and text file with character data [save].
   In CrystalFont\saved you will get saved texture,
   and chars text file (.cf or .fontdef for OGRE).
7. Save coloring schemes [.clr] and whole font projects [.fnt],
   browse and load saved files.
8. Modify coloring scheme by adding predefined channels
   (simple, circle, line, point, star, diamond)
   and modify their parameters (along with color) [Color].
9. Coloring scheme can also be saved as texture for given sizes (rect).
10. Zoom preview texture or see chosen character.

Running

Go to CrystalFont\bin and run CrystalFont.exe.
Press F11 to show keyboard help, use left,right to change pages.
Program doesn't support mouse, so every action comes from keyborard.
Use existing .fnt files to load whole font settings,
browse .clr files for existing coloring schemes, to apply for font/glow.

Note: some texture bug still appears when changing many font projects,
restarting program and loading font again resolves it.

The code is quite old (started in 2006),
all computations go on CPU, so for big font sizes (>120)
and wide glow applyied it can take few secons to draw.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using fonts

Saved fonts can be used to draw any text in own applications,
needed data is saved in .cf text file as follows:

--- minimal version: ---
CrystalFont 4.46	- first line, program version
33					- font height (for every character the same)
32 122				- characters range (ascii codes, ' ' to 'z')
0 0 8 				- for each character from range:
8 0 5 				-   x and y position in texture, and width
...

--- extended version: ---
CrystalFont 4.46
chars_height = 33
chars_from = 32
chars_to = 122
x=0  y=0  w=8
x=8  y=0  w=5
...

--- abc and full versions save additional character data like
a,b,c widths etc.

The program itself is using own created fonts, which can be seen
in CrystalFont\data, fixed and variable width.

Compiling

To compile under Visual Studio 2008 use the included vcproj/sln file.
Program is written in C++, it should be easy to use other compilers.
You need to have DirectX SDK installed and
properly set VC Directories to include and library SDK dirs
(used March 2009 release, should do fine with others).
